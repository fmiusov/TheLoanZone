         I have strayed from this code to make it my own, and am using this project as a 
         learning exercise with no intent to profit or claim sole authorship. I found this code
         to be very strange in how it styles a static page as one big table, including empty spaces
         so I wanted to pick it apart to better understand the thought process. -->
